                             NEWCOM TAVERN


    [Illustration: Col. George Newcom still revealed the flinty quality
    that tamed the wilderness when he sat for this daguerreotype in 1852
    at the age of 81. Dayton was already a bustling town, with a classic
    courthouse that ranked among the country’s finest structures.]

    [Illustration: Newcom’s first cabin, of round logs instead of
    square-hewn logs, later served as kitchen for the structure now in
    Carillon Park. Smaller building disappeared many years ago. (Etching

By the mid-1700s, a few intrepid men from “back East” had explored the
land of the Miami Indians. Upon their return to the seaboard these
scouts sat about their firesides painting attractive word-pictures of
the territory beyond the Alleghenies. It was “rich, level and
well-timbered.” Clover, rye and bluegrass were abundant, along with
enough small game, deer and wild turkey to keep any number of settlers
from want. The countryside, in the words of one report, was “just
waiting to be tickled with the hoe that it might laugh with a harvest.”

It was to be almost another half-century, however, before anyone packed
up his wife, musket and hoe and established a home in these fertile
lands of legend. The Miamis—a tribe of the Algonquin family in powerful
league with the Shawnees, Wyandots, Potawatomies and the Ottawas—were
determined to keep the white man off the prime hunting grounds that lay
between the Great and Little Miami rivers. They frequently crossed the
Ohio to raid threatening settlements in Kentucky territory, and the
doughty Kentuckians in return made bloody sorties into the Indians’
Miami Valley. Two of the fiercest encounters were fought on the triangle
of land where the Mad River meets the Great Miami.

    [Illustration: 1896 view of the Tavern on Monument Avenue, four
    years after it was moved there from the southwest corner of Main and
    Monument.]

    [Illustration: Late nineteenth century photograph of Tavern’s yard

    [Illustration: In 1896, on the hundredth anniversary of Dayton’s
    founding, these women donned pioneer dress and demonstrated the
    skills of their mothers and grandmothers. The picture, taken in one
    of the two upstairs rooms at Newcom Tavern, shows spinning,
    knitting, use of the flax wheel and quilting.]

Things were desperate—hardly secure for family life and farming—until
that able general, “Mad Anthony” Wayne, led a force of 3600 daring men
into Ohio country. The eventual surrender of the Miamis (led by Chief
Little Turtle) resulted in the Treaty of Greenville, and the end of the
strife that had kept the Valley a wilderness. The treaty was signed in
1795, a little over a decade after Ohio, as part of the Northwest
Territory, had come under control of the United States, and Congress had
authorized sale of the land.

In the year of the treaty, Jonathan Dayton, head of a New Jersey land
company which also included Generals Wilkinson and St. Clair and a
Colonel Ludlow, acquired the so-called “seventh and eighth ranges”
between the two Miami Rivers, and employed surveyors to lay out a town
site. The town was to take Jonathan Dayton’s name, although he was never
to lay eyes on the holding. Ludlow (in the company of the surveyor,
Daniel Cooper) was the only member of the land company to make the
westward trek.

Newcom Tavern was one of the first structures to be erected in Dayton,
and it is the oldest Dayton building now standing. Long a familiar
landmark of Van Cleve Park, on Monument Avenue in downtown Dayton, the
Tavern was moved to Carillon Park in the summer of 1964. Here, it is
much more accessible to the public than it was in the congested business
district, and it has the wooded setting that a frontier relic deserves.

It was in the spring of 1796 that three groups of settlers headed north
from Cincinnati. One party came by flat boat, or pirogue, which was
laboriously poled up the Miami. The other two groups came overland—one
by wagon, the other on foot, leading packhorses and driving cattle.

    [Illustration: Early household utensils include, on shelf at left, a
    hearth rotisserie and a foot warmer. Corn crusher stands in the
    corner and on shelf at right are various grinders, a dough board and
    a cypress knee in which salt was kept.]

The latter party was led by Colonel George Newcom, a veteran of Wayne’s
campaign against the redskins. Newcom immediately chose a lot on the
southwest corner of Main and Water (now Monument Avenue) Streets, where
the Newcom Manor apartments were later erected. He put up a one-room
cabin of round logs as temporary shelter, then engaged one Robert Edgar
to build a permanent house—18 by 22 feet, of square-hewn logs, with a
loft above reached by a ladder. The small original shelter served as
kitchen to the larger house for a while, but eventually was razed.

    [Illustration: Simple furnishings and venerable logs bring
    extraordinary warmth and charm to this first-floor bedroom. Corn
    husks were used as fill for the mattress; bed was used by the
    Newcoms, and was probably made in Dayton.]

John F. Edgar, son of Robert, left a detailed account of those early
days in his book, “Pioneer Life in Dayton and Vicinity,” published in
1896. Concerning construction of the log tavern, he wrote:

“The agreement was that Newcom should pay Edgar six shillings
(seventy-five cents) per day for cutting and hewing the logs for the
‘best house in Dayton,’ to front on Main and Water Streets, and Edgar
for his board agreed to furnish Newcom the carcass of a deer once every
week, retaining the skin. This was full payment for his board and
lodging. In order to comply with this part of his contract without
breaking a day’s work, my father would rise early, hide in the bushes on
this side of the river at Main Street, and watch for the deer to come
down to the river on the north side for their morning drink, when,
choosing the best-looking one, he never failed to drop him. He would
then, with his canoe, bring his week’s board across the river before
breakfast....”

    [Illustration: Main room of Newcom Tavern contains long table at
    which early travelers were served. Utensils in the fireplace include
    a griddle, pots of various types and, visible at lower left, a bread
    toaster that could be moved up to the hot coals by a long handle.
    Board at right of the fireplace holds rifle, powder horn and bullet
    mold. Items in the Tavern are appropriate to Dayton’s earliest
    years, although not all of them were actually used by the Newcom
    family. Fireplace facing was rebuilt with original stones, which
    probably came from Miami River bed.]

    [Illustration: View of the Tavern on its downtown site, from across
    the Miami River. Steele high school is at right, Memorial Hall at
    left. Picture was taken sometime between 1910 and 1918, because
    Memorial Hall was built in 1910 and the Engineer’s Club, built in
    1918 on the southeast corner of Monument and Jefferson, is not yet
    in evidence.]

Elsewhere in his book, Edgar tells us that Newcom was born in Ireland in
1771, and came to America with his parents in 1775. The family first
settled in Delaware, then moved to the vicinity of Middletown, Pa. In
1794, Newcom and his wife, the former Mary Henderson, migrated to
Cincinnati—and thence to Dayton. Of their arduous northward journey,
historian Edgar wrote:

“The party led by George Newcom overland met with few difficulties as
far as Fort Hamilton, the road to that place being kept in good
condition by the army. From that point on, the road had been only
recently surveyed by Mr. Cooper and his corps of helpers, and was in
such primitive condition that it was necessary in crossing small streams
to fell trees for footbridges. For the larger streams rafts were made to
carry the people and the freight, the cattle and horses swimming across.
All the property was carried in creels [a kind of wickerwork basket] on
packhorses, the children that were too small to walk being also carried
in the creels, their heads only showing. Game being plentiful the party
suffered no hardship from lack of food, but the nights were cold and the
hastily constructed camps afforded but little shelter, the beds being
made in the open air by spreading blankets over brush. This party was
about two weeks on the road.”

Edgar got his lime mortar by burning stones from the river. The size of
the cabin was doubled two years later by addition of the section on the
left. (The joining point is marked by the vertical logs just to the
right of the present doorway.) The new house, completely whitewashed at
first, became the hub for much of Dayton’s early activity. It housed the
town’s first school. The first church service was held there. It served
as courthouse, council chamber, store and, most colorfully, as a
crossroads tavern for the wagon men and drovers who were fanning out
into the lush Northwest Territory.

In addition to service as Dayton’s first tavern and trading post
operator, Newcom was Montgomery county’s first sheriff and jailer, was
elected to the State Senate in 1815, and succeeded Benjamin Van Cleve
(one of the men who came north by flatboat) in the office of clerk of
the court. The Colonel also was first president of Dayton’s first bank,
and somehow found the time to serve in the War of 1812. He died in 1853
at the age of 82, having lived to see his community’s crowning glory—the
stately Grecian courthouse that was dedicated in 1850, and is still
standing at Third and Main.

    [Illustration: Serene view of the Tavern on its Monument Avenue
    site. Skirmish with Indians took place on the point of land at the
    left of photograph.]

After Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, Montgomery county was formed. (It
is named after General Richard Montgomery, who was killed in the
Revolutionary War attack on Quebec.) An act of Congress made Dayton the
county seat in 1804, and designated George Newcom’s log house a
temporary courthouse.

The Tavern was quartermaster headquarters for General Hull’s army in the
War of 1812 under the command of Colonel Robert Patterson, grandfather
of the founder of The National Cash Register Company, John H. Patterson.

The first “native Daytonian” was, incidentally, born in Newcom Tavern.
She was Jane Newcom, daughter of the owner and his wife, Mary.

    [Illustration: Ready for the big move from Monument Avenue to
    Carillon Park, in summer of 1964, Tavern stood trussed in I-beams
    and heavy timbers. Newcom Manor apartments, barely visible at right
    of photo, were built on Tavern’s original site at southwest corner
    of Main and Monument.]

The Tavern stood on its original site almost a century. It was an inn
until 1836, after which it served as a general store. The years saw many
changes in the rude structure: it was plastered on the inside and
weather boarded on the outside; even the shape of the roof was changed.
Townspeople were generally unaware of its historic significance when, in
1894, architect Charles Insco Williams started to raze it to make way
for the apartment building. Removal of the clapboards revealed the
original logs. John H. Patterson, always interested in local history,
had the Tavern moved at his own expense to the Monument Avenue location.
The Daughters of the American Revolution raised money by public
subscription to have it restored, and the Montgomery County Historical
Society subsequently operated it as a museum of pioneer relics.

    [Illustration: With only a couple of inches to spare, the roof of
    Newcom Tavern is eased through Route 25 underpass on its way to
    Carillon Park.]

Current contents of Newcom Tavern pertain strictly to the earliest days
of Dayton, without the items from later periods that were displayed at
the Monument Avenue location.

We see a set of antlers, possibly from one of the deer shot by Robert
Edgar during his daybreak vigils at the Miami river. A rocker and a
cradle came up the river with the Thompson family, from whom the Wright
brothers were descended. Among other interesting furniture are Colonel
Newcom’s favorite chair, a rope bed typical of the period, a spinning
wheel, and the long table which served in the tavern dining room.
Pewter, odds and ends of dishes, brooms, stone jugs, a bullet mold, a
corn grinder and a coffee mill are among the artifacts. An item of
special curiosity is a sand box dating from the time the cabin was used
as a school. The box wasn’t for play, however; pupils, lacking paper,
inscribed their lessons in the smooth sand, and “erased” them after the
schoolmaster’s inspection.

For the two-mile trailer trip from Monument Avenue to Carillon Park, the
roof of the Tavern was removed so the structure would pass under power
lines. The sides were braced with stout timbers and steel framing, and a
number of termite-weakened logs were replaced. Fortunately, some
weathered but sturdy logs were found in an old barn, so all of the
structure retains the 1796 appearance. All in all, it was a touchy job
of moving—likened by one observer to “holding a house of cards in one
hand while dodging under low doorways.”

    [Illustration: Tavern is reassembled at Carillon Park next to the
    stone pioneer house. Rude log houses were typical of earliest
    frontier construction, although stone was often used in areas where
    it was plentiful. Chimney design of Carillon Park’s stone house,
    seen in background of the photograph, shows influence of the
    Moravians, a religious sect that came to Ohio from North Carolina,
    Pennsylvania and Georgia in the early 1800s.]

    [Illustration: The Tavern is seen on its new site just after
    restoration.]

Robert Edgar, like most pioneer builders, used a wide range of
woods—whatever was available in the surrounding forest. Ash, hickory,
walnut, beech, elm, oak, sycamore—all these are identifiable in the
Tavern. The large fireplace is lined with limestone and faced with
rubble stone from the river. The logs rest upon one another at the
mortised corners, without attachment, although wooden pegs can be seen
in mortised interior beams. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the
structure is the stick and mortar chimney, typical of early houses in
regions where stone was scarce and costly. Stone was plentiful by the
Miami, but Edgar, no doubt handier with the adz than the trowel, stuck
to the easier, faster method.

Newcom Tavern—its logs freshly mortared and stained—is as sound as it
was the day, more than a century and a half ago, when Robert Edgar
proudly put the final course of sticks on his primitive chimney. Here at
Carillon Park, receiving the best of maintenance, this link with the
past will divert many future generations of Daytonians, and remind them
of their community’s heritage.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
